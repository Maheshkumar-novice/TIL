To copy the entire contents of a file in Vim, you can use the following steps:

1. Open the file you want to copy in Vim.

2. Press `gg` to move the cursor to the top of the file.

3. Press `vG` to select the entire file.

4. Press `y` to yank (copy) the selected text.

Now, the entire contents of the file have been copied to Vim's clipboard. You can then paste the contents wherever you need them, using the `p` command.

Here's a summary of the steps:

1. `gg` - Move to the top of the file
2. `vG` - Select the entire file
3. `y` - Yank (copy) the selected text

This method copies the entire file contents without modifying the file itself. If you want to copy the file and then open it in a new buffer, you can use the `:new` or `:tabnew` commands after yanking the text.
