In Python, `yield` and `yield from` are both used in generator functions to produce values lazily, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts. Here's a detailed comparison of the two:

### `yield`

The `yield` keyword is used to create a generator function, which allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without having to store the entire sequence in memory. Each time the generator's `__next__()` method is called (or when iterating with a loop), it resumes execution of the generator function from where it left off and yields the next value.

**Example of `yield`:**

```python
def simple_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# Usage
gen = simple_generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

**Explanation:**
- The `simple_generator` function yields values one at a time: `1`, `2`, and `3`.
- When iterating over `gen`, each call to `__next__()` (or each iteration of the loop) resumes execution of the generator from the last `yield` statement.

### `yield from`

The `yield from` expression is used to delegate part of the generator's operations to another iterable. It simplifies the code when you want to yield values from a sub-iterator or a nested generator.

**Example of `yield from`:**

```python
def sub_generator():
    yield 4
    yield 5
    yield 6

def main_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield from sub_generator()  # Delegates to sub_generator
    yield 7

# Usage
gen = main_generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

**Explanation:**
- `main_generator` first yields `1` and `2`.
- It then delegates to `sub_generator` using `yield from`, which yields `4`, `5`, and `6`.
- After `sub_generator` finishes, `main_generator` continues to yield `7`.

### Key Differences

1. **Delegation to Sub-Iterators**:
   - **`yield`**: Can only yield individual values directly. To yield from another iterator, you need to use a loop or additional code.
   - **`yield from`**: Simplifies yielding values from an iterable or another generator by delegating the iteration and yielding process to the sub-iterator.

2. **Code Simplicity**:
   - **`yield`**: When dealing with nested generators or iterables, you need to write more boilerplate code to loop through and yield values.
   - **`yield from`**: Automatically handles the iteration and yielding, making the code cleaner and more concise.

3. **Handling of Return Values**:
   - **`yield from`**: Can return a value from the sub-generator, which is the final value returned by the generator.
   - **`yield`**: Does not handle return values from sub-generators.

**Example of Handling Return Values with `yield from`:**

```python
def sub_generator():
    yield 4
    yield 5
    return 'done'

def main_generator():
    result = yield from sub_generator()
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield result

# Usage
gen = main_generator()
for value in gen:
    print(value)
```

**Output:**
```
4
5
1
2
done
```

In this example, `sub_generator` returns `'done'`, and `main_generator` yields this value after all values from `sub_generator` have been yielded.

### Summary

- **`yield`**: Use it to yield values one at a time within a generator function. Suitable for simple cases where you are generating values directly.
- **`yield from`**: Use it to delegate part of the generation process to another iterable or generator, simplifying the code and handling the iteration internally. Ideal for cases where you want to yield all values from another iterable or generator.

Both `yield` and `yield from` are powerful tools for working with generators, and understanding when to use each can help you write more efficient and readable Python code.
